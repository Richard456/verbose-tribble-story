Once upon a time, there was a famous coder living in a city called Nosidam. 
He wrote a miraculous algorithm that could solve any problem and dispute in the kingdom.
It worked so effectively that the rulers didnâ€™t sit by a large round table to hold meetings anymore. 
Instead, they sit in front of computers, stared at these little screens, and did whatever was instructed by
the algorithm.
This system functioned so perfectly until one day there was a bug detected by an engineer. 

Since the kingdom's economy and policies relied on the algorithm to work
properly, the bug caused panic and disarray. Critical situation was declared in
Nosidam. And when almost all hope was lost one brave man decided to find a
programmer talented enough to fix such a bug. His first destinatin was a small
town in Wisconsin, called Madison.

The engineer went crazy searching for this individual, when he came across a talented programmer!
He told the engineer that he could fix this bug but he would need his team to help, they are called
xteam 102 - International Squad. The team went straight to work and were able to defeat the bug and 
restore peace to the Kingdom.

The ruler became so happy and wanted to hire them forever, but they rejected his offer and they 
became legend. They show up only when bug show up, and they help people needed and remain as
a mystery team.

Actually, the members of this team are all students and they are still taking cs400. The reason why
they managed to fix the bugs was all by luck. However, they knew that luck could not be with them forever,
and skills are the one really matters. Therefore, they decided to work hard in cs400 and become real legend
in the future.
