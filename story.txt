Once upon a time, there was a famous coder living in a city called Nosidam. 
He wrote a miraculous algorithm that could solve any problem and dispute in the kingdom.
It worked so effectively that the rulers didnâ€™t sit by a large round table to hold meetings anymore. 
Instead, they sit in front of computers, stared at these little screens, and did whatever was instructed by
the algorithm.
This system functioned so perfectly until one day there was a bug detected by an engineer.
